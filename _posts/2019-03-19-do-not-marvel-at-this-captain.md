It goes without saying that my family does not have a TV in the house, so it's taken me a while to learn about this new "Captain Marvel" thing. I overheard a few of the younger girls from some of the newer families in our church discussing this movie with their friends, so I started asking some questions. It didn't take long for me to realize that we were facing a real crisis in the church. I had to say something.

Let me assure all of you who are reading this that Captain Marvel is a true fulfillment of a century's worth of Hollywood feminist propaganda hell-bent on turning our girls into boys. It wasn't that long ago that our girls could look up to Biblical role models like Cindarella, Sleeping Beauty, or Belle. These were model women who knew how to rely on a man for everything, and look pretty for them, just the way God intended. But the 60s turned everything upside-down, and now men can't even get jobs anymore becuase there are women taking their jobs! 

And don't even get me _started_ on women these days with their sass-mouth kids, sauntering up and down telling men what to do. Why, just the other week, after church, a woman came up to my husband and asked him if he could move his car so she could have some extra room to get into hers. And my poor husband, bless him, did move the car, but can you imagine his shame at being asked by a woman to do _her_ a favor? That is just not what the good Lord intended of us.

So, to all you women reading this, let me remind you: God has set the standard for us that we should shut our mouths, feed our husbands, and keep our kids in line. It's a simple task, but it's the one we've been asked to do. Don't let your guard down and let this feminist propaganda soil the minds of our innocent children. 

As I remind my daughters every day, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. (1 Timothy 2:12 ESV)" Let's all remember to keep it simple: Don't marvel at any captain that isn't a man.
