_Louisville, KY_

Sovereign Grace Churches announced a plan today to begin a 3rd party investigation into allegations of widespread mishandling and coverup of sexual abuse within the denomination. 

Allegations have been swirling around the beleaguered denomination for more than a year. In January of 2018 Rachael Denhollander made public statements regarding longstanding accusations that sexual abuse cases have been mishandled and covered up within the organization for the last 20 years. Christianity Today followed up her statements with their own article, published in March of 2018: _[We Need an Independent Investigation of Sovereign Grace Ministries](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/march-web-only/sovereign-grace-need-investigation-sgm-mahaney-denhollander.html)_. 

SGC responded with its own [anemic](http://sovereigngrace.com/sovereign-grace-blog/post/sovereign-grace-churches-response-to-christianity-today-article_2) [statements](http://www.sovereigngrace.com/sovereign-grace-blog/post/sovereign-grace-churches-statement-to-christianity-today), then sat in silence.

Then, earlier this year Al Mohler, President of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, [distanced himself](http://news.sbts.edu/2019/02/15/statement-r-albert-mohler-jr-sovereign-grace-churches/) from Sovereign Grace Churches and its former leader, CJ Mahaney. Mohler said at the time that he had made "serious errors" with regard to his response to these allegations and his support of SGC.

It seems that the pressure has finally resulted in some action on the part of SGC, which [announced this morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that they would be submitting to a full and independent investigation.

After passing an emergency resolution last night, SGC will be requiring all of its churches to participate fully with the investigation or be removed permanently from the denomination.

Al Mohler and Rachael Denhollander released a joint comment this morning regarding the investigation, saying, "We are thrilled to see SGC humbly embracing this process for the good of God's kingdom and the reputation of His church." Denhollander, who will be an advisor to one of the committees involved, added, "I am honored to aid in this process. As God's people, we never have to fear the Truth. We can celebrate justice together when this investigation has concluded."

The investigation is set to begin immediately, and expected to take a year to complete.

You can read the statement in full here:

> After many years of accusations, the time has come for a new investigation. 
> 
> Allegations of mishandling of sexual abused cases have ebbed and flowed against our denomination over the past decade. Over that time we have sought to address those allegations by conducting our own investigations and updating our polity to allow for a clearer path to mediating situations of this kind.
>
> Clearly these efforts have not been sufficient.
>
> As a family of churches who love and follow Jesus, we want our reputations to remain unstained, so that we can represent him well to the world around us. We realize that until we address these allegations we will not have the rapport required to do that.
>
> We had hoped that our previous efforts to address these issues would have been sufficient, but clearly, they were not. While we maintain that there is no substance to the accusations against us, we realize that it is a poor reflection upon our commitment to truth and justice for us to stand in the way of an investigation any longer. 
>
> We are committed to the safety, protection, and care of each and every individual in our churches. Therefore, we will embrace any process that might reveal situtions where this has not occurred.
>
> Because we are an Elder-led organization this process has required approval by our Council of Elders. Last night the leadership team, in cooperation with the executive committee, submitted an emergency proposal to the CoE regarding this investigation. It was voted on, and approved, though not unanimously. Any churches who are unwilling to participate in this process will be removed from fellowship and ineligible to reapply in the future.
>
> The way this process will work is simple: The organization tasked with performing this investigation will be doing a process of "Discovery" for the next six months. During that time, anyone wishing to submit evidence of wrongdoing or mishandling of sexual abuse cases within any Sovereign Grace Church may submit such evidence direcly to the investigators. SGC will have no part in this discovery process.
>
> Once discovery has ended, the investigative work will continue through interviews and additional evidence gathering. We estimate that this process will take a further six months. 
>
> Upon conclusion of their investigation, the full report will be made public by the investigators (personal information will be redacted for the safety and privacy of any victims or minors that might be involved).
>
> At that point a special committee will be formed, and should it be necessary, charges will be filed and tried within the process of our Book of Church order. We have invited a set of 5 outside advisors to advise this committee, including Rachael Denhollander. The recommendations of these advisors and the decisions of the committee  will be published as well.
>
> We are committed to full-participation in this process, and we are confident in God's committment to Truth and to Justice in all things. We rest in the goodness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and it is with joy that we embrace this season of evaluation and reflection. 
>
> To God be the Glory, now and forever.

## APRIL FOOLS!

In reality, SGC continues in their attempts to sandbag credible accusations and gaslight those who ask questions about them, all while dragging the reputation of Jesus Christ and his church further and further into the depths of the bog they refuse to walk out of.
