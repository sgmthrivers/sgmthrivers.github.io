_Louisville, KY_

Sovereign Grace Churches announced a plan today to begin a "3rd party" investigation into allegations of widespread mishandling and coverup of sexual abuse within the denomination. 

Bowing to recent pressure, SGC Executive Director Mark Prater announced via Twitter this morning that he was "tired of all this sex stuff." Promising to "get this over with," he assured his followers that this would "take care of things once and for all." He went on to detail his plan:

"Listen, we're brining in Karen. You all know Karen, right? She's a 3rd party, independent. Hasn't voted for a Democrat or Republican for 20 years now. I think she's librarian party or something. Anyway, Karen is going to come in for a few hours for us next week. We've got an email address all set up for her. If you've got a problem with us, you send an email to Karen, and she'll investigate. If she find a problem, she'll let me know. Simple as that."

While Prater assured his followers that there would be no bias, critics asked how such an informal investigation could be trusted.

"Our members have been with us for decades," Prater said, "they trust us as their elders to think for them. They won't have any problem trusting us with this."

When pressed for more details, our reporter was told by Prater that he "wouldn't allow a woman to teach him." He refused to comment further.
